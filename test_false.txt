Abstract: Using connected dominating set (CDS) to serve as a virtual backbone in
a wireless networks can save energy and reduce interference. Since nodes may fail due
to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable that the virtual backbone has
some fault-tolerance. A k-connected m-fold dominating set ((k, m)-CDS) of a graph G
is a node set D such that every node in V \ D has at least m neighbors in D and the
subgraph of G induced by D is k-connected. Using (k, m)-CDS can tolerate the failure of
min{k ? 1, m ? 1} nodes. In this paper, we study Minimum Weight (1, m)-CDS problem
((1, m)-MWCDS), and present an (H(?+m)+2H(??1))-approximation algorithm, where
? is the maximum degree of the graph and H(?) is the Harmonic number. Notice that
there is a 1.35 ln n-approximation algorithm for the (1, 1)-MWCDS problem, where n is
the number of nodes in the graph. Though our constant in O(ln ?) is larger than 1.35, n
is replaced by ?. Such a replacement enables us to obtain a 3.67-approximation for the
connecting part of (1, m)-MWCDS problem on unit disk graphs.

1 Introduction
A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of spatially distributed autonomous sensors
to monitor physical or environmental condition, and to cooperatively pass their data
through the network. During recent years, WSN has been widely used in many fields,
1
such as environment and habitat monitoring, disaster recovery, health applications, etc.
Since there is no fixed or predefined infrastructure in WSNs, frequent flooding of control
messages from sensors may cause a lot of redundant contentions and collisions. Therefore,
people have proposed the concept of virtual backbone which corresponds to a connected
dominating set in a graph (Das and Bhargharan [4] and Ephremides et al. [8]).
Given a graph G with node set V and edge set E, a subset of nodes C ? V is said to
be a dominating set (DS) of G if any v ? V \ C is adjacent to at least one node of C. We
say that a dominating set C of G is a connected dominating set of G if the subgraph of
G induced by C, denoted by G[C], is connected. Nodes in C are called dominators, the
nodes in V \ C are called dominatees.
Because sensors in a WSN are prone to failures due to accidental damage or battery
depletion, it is important to maintain a certain degree of redundancy such that the virtual
backbone is more fault-tolerant. In a more general setting, every sensor has a cost, it
is desirable that under the condition that tasks can be successfully accomplished, the
whole cost of virtual backbone is as small as possible. These considerations lead to the
Minimum Node-Weighted k-Connected m-Fold Dominating Set problem (abbreviated as
(k, m)-MWCDS), which is defined as follows:
Definition 1.1 ((k, m)-MWCDS). Let G be a connected graph, k and m be two positive
integers, c : V ? R+ be a cost function on nodes. A node subset D ? V is an m-fold
dominating set (m-DS) if every node in V \ D has at least m neighbors in D. It is a kconnected m-fold dominating set ((k, m)-CDS) if furthermore, the subgraph of G induced
by D is k-connected. The (k, m)-MWCDS problem is to find a (k, m)-CDS D such that
the cost of D is minimized, that is, c(D) = P
u?D
c(u) is as small as possible.
After Dai and Wu [3] proposed using (k, k)-CDS as a model for fault-tolerant virtual
backbone, a lot of approximation algorithms emerged, most of which are on unit disk
graphs. In a unit disk graph (UDG), every node corresponds to a sensor on the plane,
two nodes are adjacent if and only if the Euclidean distance between the corresponding
sensors is at most one unit. There are a lot of studies on fault-tolerant virtual backbone
in UDG which assume unit weight on each disk. However, for a general graph with a
general weight function, related studies are rare.
In this paper, we present a (H(? + m) + 2H(? ? 1))-approximation algorithm for the
(1, m)-MWCDS problem on a general graph, where ? is the maximum degree of the graph,
and H(?) = P?
1
1/i is the Harmonic number. It is a two-phase greedy algorithm. First,
it constructs an m-fold dominating set D1 of G. Then it connects D1 by adding a set
of connectors D2. It is well known that if the potential function and the cost function
related with a greedy algorithm is monotone increasing and submodular, then an O(ln n)
performance ration can be achieved. Unfortunately, for various minimum CDS problems,
no such potential functions are known. Nevertheless, we manage, in this paper, to deal
with a nonsubmodular potential function and achieve an O(ln ?) performance ratio.
It should be pointed out that for a general graph, Guha and Khuller [11] proposed a
1.35 ln n-approximation for the (1, 1)-MWCDS problem. Though our constant in O(ln n)
2
is larger, the parameter n in the performance ratio is replaced by ?. In many cases, ? might
be substantially smaller than n. In particular, for an UDG, due to such an replacement,
after having found an m-DS, the connecting part has a performance ratio at most 3.67. In
[34], Zou et al. proposed a method for the connecting part with performance ratio at most
3.875, which makes use of a 1.55-approximation algorithm [16] for the classic Minimum
Steiner Tree problem. If using currently best ratio for Minimum Steiner Tree problem [1],
then their ratio is at most 3.475. Notice that the algorithm in [1] uses randomized iterative
rounding. So, although our ratio 3.67 is a litter larger than 3.475, our algorithm has the
advantage that it is purely combinatorial. Furthermore, we believe that our method is
also of more theoretical interests and may find more applications in the study of other
related problems.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related works.
Some notation and some preliminary are given in Section 3. In Section 4, the algorithm
is presented. Section 5 analyzes the performance ratio. Section 6 improves the ratio on
unit disk graph. Section 7 concludes the paper.

The idea of using a connected dominating set as a virtual backbone for WSN was
proposed by Das and Bhargharan [4] and Ephremides et al. [8]. Constructing a CDS
of the minimum size is NP-hard. In fact, Guha and Khuller [11] proved that a minimum CDS cannot be approximated within ? ln n for any 0 < ? < 1 unless NP ?
DT IME(n
O(loglogn)
). In the same paper, they proposed two greedy algorithms with performance ratios of 2(H(?)+ 1) and H(?)+ 2, respectively, where ? is the maximum degree
of the graph and H(?) is the harmonic number. This was improved by Ruan et al. [17]
to 2 + ln ?. Du et al. [5] presented a (1 + ?) ln(? ? 1)-approximation algorithm, where ?
is an arbitrary positive real number.
For unit disk graphs, a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) was given by
Cheng et al. [2], which was generalized to higher dimensional space by Zhang et al. [28].
There are a lot of studies on distributed algorithms for this problem. For a comprehensive
study on CDS in UDG, the readers may refer to the book [7].
Considering the weighted version of the CDS problem, Guha and Khuller [11] proposed
a (cn+1) ln n-approximation algorithm in a general graph, where cn ln k is the performance
ratio for the node weighted Steiner tree problem (k is the number of terminal nodes to
be connected). Later, they [12] improved it to an algorithm of performance ratio at most
(1.35 + ?) ln n. For the minimum weight CDS in UDG, Zou et al. [34] gave a (9.875 + ?)-
approximation.
The problem of constructing fault-tolerant virtual backbones was introduced by Dai
and Wu [3]. They proposed three heuristic algorithms for the minimum (k, k)-CDS problem. However, no performance ratio analysis was given. A lot of works have been done for
the CDS problem in UDG. The first constant approximation algorithm in this aspect was
3
given by Wang et al. [24], who obtained a 72-approximation for the (2, 1)-CDS problem
in UDG. Shang et al. [18] gave an algorithm for the minimum (1, m)-CDS problem and
an algorithm for the minimum (2, m)-CDS problem in UDG, the performance ratios are
5 + 5
m
for m ? 5 and 7 for m > 5, and 5 + 25
m
for 2 ? m ? 5 and 11 for m > 5, respectively. Constant approximation algorithms also exist for (3, m)-CDS in UDG [25, 26].
Recently, Shi et al. [20] presented the first constant approximation algorithm for general
(k, m)-CDS on UDG.
For the fault-tolerant CDS problem in a general graph, Zhang et al. [30] gave a
2rH(?r + m ? 1)-approximation for the minimum r-hop (1, m)-CDS problem, where ?r is
the maximum degree in Gr
, the r-th power graph of G. A node u is r-hop dominated by
a set D if it is at most r-hops away from D. In particular, taking r = 1, the algorithm in
[30] has performance ratio at most 2H(? + m ? 1) for the minimum (1, m)-CDS problem.
This was improved by our recent work [33] to 2 + H(? + m ? 2). We also gave an
(ln ? + o(ln ?))-approximation algorithm for the minimum (2, m)-CDS problem [19] and
the minimum (3, m)-CDS problem [32] on a general graph.
For the weighted version of fault-tolerant CDS problem on UDG, as a consequence of
recent work [13], the minimum weight (1, 1)-CDS problem admits a PTAS. Combining
the constant approximation algorithm for the minimum weight m-fold dominating set
problem [9] and the 3.475-approximation algorithm for the connecting part [34], (1, m)-
MWCDS on UDG admits a constant-approximation. Recently, we [20, 31] gave the first
constant approximation algorithm for the general minimum weight (k, m)-CDS problem
on unit disk graph.
As far as we know, there is no previous work on the approximation of the weighted
version of fault-tolerant CDS problem in a general graph.
Notice that in [34], the 3.875-approximation for the connecting part is based on the
1.55-approximation algorithm [16] for the classic minimum Steiner tree problem. If the
best known ratio for the Steiner tree problem is used, which is 1.39 currently, then their
connecting part has performance ratio at most 3.475. Notice that the 1.39-approximation
for the Steiner tree problem uses randomized iterative rounding. So, although our performance ratio is larger than 3.475, it has the advantage that it is purely combinatorial.
